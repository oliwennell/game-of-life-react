# Game of Life - React

An implementation of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using [React](https://reactjs.org/).  
My motivation was to go beyond "hello world" whilst learning React.  

See it running [here](https://oliwennell.github.io/game-of-life-react/).

## Setup

(Requires node.js version 8 or higher).

Clone the repo then
```
npm install
```

## Running

```

The app will then be hosted on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Testing

```
npm test
